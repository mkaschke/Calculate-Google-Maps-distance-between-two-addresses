This little snippet of code will calculate the distance between two addresses with the help of google maps in MS Excel.

This is what you have to do: 

* Open MS Excel and press Alt + F11 to open the VBA editor Right click on "Microsoft Excel Object" and create  a new Modul
* Copy the code into the Modul

To use the code:  
```
=GetDistance(address 1;address 2)/1000
```
The "/1000" is just for the conversion km to meter
